## 📖 About The Project

**SIMON** (Smart Thesis Topic Finder) is a desktop-based information system designed to function as a monitoring and consultation tool. It specifically assists Informatics Engineering students in determining suitable thesis topics based on their individual interests and capabilities.

Students often face confusion when deciding the direction of their final project. This application serves as a comprehensive solution by utilizing an **Expert System** with a **Forward Chaining** method. It analyzes user responses to structured questions to provide precise, rule-based topic recommendations (such as AI, Software Engineering, Networking, IoT, or Data Science).

This project was developed as part of the coursework at **Politeknik Negeri Jakarta** (State Polytechnic of Jakarta).
